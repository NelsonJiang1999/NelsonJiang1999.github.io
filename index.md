## Research Interests

**<font color="#990000">I am actively seeking a PhD position for 2025 Fall admission. I could also apply for funding from China Scholarship Counsil (CSC) if needed which could support my living expenses abroad. If you have any information, please contact me!</font>**

- Oncology, especially malignant tumors of the urinary system. 
- Etiology of cancer/ Early screening.
- Mechanisms related to tumor progression and metastasis.
- Translation of laboratory research achievements into clinical practice.
- I am also willing to study other fields related to clinical medicine because I have had **in-depth communication and participation in the treatment** of patients with diseases in various systems in my clinical work.

All the fields above are **<font color="#990000">closely related</font>** to my **current research** topic and **future career planning** ——being an outstanding researcher and surgeon.  I wish to devote my effort to this meaningful cause and bring well-being to society.

## Self Introduction

I played 2 roles simultaneously during the pursuit of a master's degree.

**Role 1: Postgraduate Student of China Medical university** <br>

I am a graduate student in the Department of Surgery and Urology at the China medical university, advised by Prof. Jianbin Bi, with a main research focus on Genitourinary Oncology (Clinical diagnosis, Treatment and Prognosis of malignant tumors of the urinary system). I have achieved an outstanding academic score in class (4th out of 153 students in our major, **Top 3%**) and will get my master degree in Clinical Medicine (Surgery) in 2025.  Detailed publications and research program are displayed in Section "Publication", "Research experience" and "Patent".

**Role 2: Surgical resident in the first affiliated hospital of China Medical University**<br>

I have also performed clinical work and surgery as a surgical resident in [the First affiliated hospital of China Medical University](https://www.cmu1h.com/home) for 3 years and **successfully passed** the Examinations of the National Certified Physicians and obtained **the Certificate of Physician Credentials** and **Certificate of Medical Licensure** in 2023. I have gained a comprehensive understanding of tumors and common diseases of different systems during my internships in various surgical departments.  I am very grateful for my deep involvement in clinical work at our hospital over the past 3 years. This experience has equipped me with: <br>

① Proficient clinical and surgical skills.<br>

② Valuable thinkings about clinical diagnosis and treatment.<br>

③ Strong communication skills with patients and teamwork abilities with colleagues.<br>

④ Ability to catch the interests of clinical workers during the process of translation from laboratory researches into clinical application. (Because I have also experienced clinical work, too!)<br>

Detailed responsibilities and work experience are presented in Section "Work experience"

If you are interested in any aspect of me, I am always open to discussions and sharing of experiences in clinical work. Feel free to reach out to me at - jiangbh.1999@gmail.com (foreign friends) and jiangbh.1999@163.com (Chinese friends).
