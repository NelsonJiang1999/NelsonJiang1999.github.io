# About Me

<img src="https://nelsonjiang1999.github.io//Bohao Jiang.jpg" class="floatpic">

Here is **Bohao Jiang (Nelson, 姜博昊)**. Throughout my master's degree, I played 2 roles simultaneously.

**Role 1: Postgraduate Student of China Medical university** <br>

I am a graduate student in the Department of Surgery and Urology at the China medical university, advised by Prof. Jianbin Bi, with a main research focus on Genitourinary Oncology (Clinical diagnosis, Treatment and Prognosis of malignant tumors of the urinary system). I have achieved an outstanding academic score in class (4th out of 153 students in our major, **Top 3%**) and will get my master degree in Clinical Medicine (Surgery) in 2025.  I have published 1 SCI paper **as the first author** and another 3 SCI papers are under review. I also played an important role in the analysis and writing of two other articles, and was listed as the second ranked **co-first author**. Up to now, I have been deeply involved in the initiation and implementation of three clinical research projects. One of them was independently designed and mainly implemented by me (which results will be used for my **graduation thesis**). I am also applying for a patent for an improved surgical instrument. Detailed publications and research program are displayed in Section "Publication", "Research experience" and "Patent"

**Role 2: Surgical resident in the first affiliated hospital of China Medical University**<br>

I have also performed clinical work and surgery as a surgical resident in [the First affiliated hospital of China Medical University](https://www.cmu1h.com/home) for 3 years and **successfully passed** the Examinations of the National Certified Physicians and obtained **the Certificate of Physician Credentials** and **Certificate of Medical Licensure** in 2023. I have gained a comprehensive understanding of tumors and common diseases of different systems during my internships in various surgical departments.  I am very grateful for my deep involvement in clinical work at our hospital over the past 3 years. This experience has equipped me with: <br>

① Proficient clinical and surgical skills.<br>

② Valuable thinkings about clinical diagnosis and treatment.<br>

③ Strong communication skills with patients and teamwork abilities with colleagues.<br>

④ Ability to catch the interests of clinical workers during the process of translation from laboratory researches into clinical application. (Because I have also experienced clinical work, too!)<br>

Detailed responsibilities and work experience are presented in Section "Work experience"

If you are interested in any aspect of me, I am always open to discussions and sharing of experiences in clinical work. Feel free to reach out to me at - jiangbh.1999@gmail.com (foreign friends) and jiangbh.1999@163.com (Chinese friends).

## Research Interests

**<font color="#990000">I am actively seeking a PhD position for 2025 Fall admission. I will apply for funding from China Scholarship Counsil (CSC) which could support my living expenses abroad. If you have any information, please contact me!</font>**

- Oncology, especially malignant tumors of the urinary system. 
- I am also willing to study tumors in other parts because I have had **in-depth communication and participation in the treatment** of patients with various systemic tumors in my clinical work.
- Mechanisms related to tumor progression and metastasis.
- Translation of laboratory research achievements into clinical practice.
- Etiology of cancer/ Early screening. 

My current research focuses on clinical treatment and control of cancer progression. And all the fields above are **<font color="#990000">closely related</font>** to my **current research** topic and **future career planning** ——being an outstanding researcher and surgeon. In a word, decryption of  the password hidden behind the treatment and progression of cancer positively influences the life of cancer sufferers.  I wish to devote my talent to this meaningful cause and bring well-being to society.
