## Self Introduction

I played 2 roles simultaneously during the pursuit of a master's degree.<br>

**Role 1: Postgraduate Student of China Medical university** <br>

I am a graduate student in the Department of Surgery and Urology at the China medical university, advised by Prof. Jianbin Bi, with a main research focus on Genitourinary Oncology (Clinical diagnosis, Treatment and Prognosis of malignant tumors of the urinary system). I have achieved an outstanding academic score in class (4th out of 153 students in our major, **Top 3%**) and will get my master degree in Clinical Medicine (Surgery) in June 2025.  Detailed publications and research program are displayed in Section "Publication", "Research experience" and "Patent".<br>

**Role 2: Surgical resident in the first affiliated hospital of China Medical University**<br>

I have also performed clinical work and surgery as a surgical resident in [the First affiliated hospital of China Medical University](https://www.cmu1h.com/home) for 3 years and **successfully passed** the Examinations of the National Certified Physicians and obtained **the Certificate of Physician Credentials** and **Certificate of Medical Licensure** in 2023. I have gained a comprehensive understanding of tumors and common diseases of different systems during my internships in various surgical departments.  I am very grateful for my deep involvement in clinical work at our hospital over the past 3 years. This experience has equipped me with: <br>

① Proficient clinical and surgical skills.<br>

② Valuable thinkings about clinical diagnosis and treatment.<br>

③ Strong communication skills with patients and teamwork abilities with colleagues.<br>

④ Ability to catch the interests of clinical workers during the process of translation from laboratory researches into clinical application. (Because I have also experienced clinical work, too!)<br>

Detailed responsibilities and work experience are presented in Section "Work experience"<br>

If you are interested in any aspect of me, I am always open to discussions and sharing of experiences in clinical work. Feel free to reach out to me at - jiangbh.1999@gmail.com (foreign friends) and jiangbh.1999@163.com (Chinese friends).
