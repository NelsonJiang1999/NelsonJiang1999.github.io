# Research experience and Projects

## 1. Establishing a prostate cancer diagnostic model using [prostate health index](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC3943368/) (PHI), multi-parameter MRI (mpMRI), and clinical biochemical indicators under machine learning methods

**Location: Department of urology, the First Affiliated Hospital of China Medical University**<br>

Role: The independent designers and main implementer of the research<br>

- **Aim**: to train a new ***non-invasive*** prostate cancer diagnostic model which includes PHI, radiological manifestations, and routine biochemical through machine learning.<br>

- **Preparation in advance** (08/2023-10/2023): Literature reviews and bioinformatic analyses ([LDSC](https://www.nature.com/articles/ng.3406)/[HDL](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41588-020-0653-y)) were conducted for the screening of suitable biochemical indicators for inclusion. Get a written approval by the ethics committee.<br>

- **Collection of the training set data**  (11/2023-08/2024): The data was retrospectively obtained from the internal system of the First Affiliated Hospital of China Medical University, which included 810 patients who undergone both PHI test and needle biopsy.<br>

- Preliminary analysis and **Interim discussion** (04/2024)<br>

- **Collection of the validation set data** (09/2024-11/2024): Cooperated with [Shandong University Affiliated Qilu Hospital](https://www.qiluhospital.com/en/) (Shandong Province, China). The inclusion/exclusion criteria remained constant with the training set. (212 patients included)<br>

- **Construction of diagnostic model and formation of manuscript** (12/2024-present): Through collaboration with bioinformatics professionals, a new diagnostic model has been established with good performance. The results will be transformed into my graduation thesis.<br>

## 2. Established a long-term clinical follow-up database for malignant urological tumors for the First affiliated hospital of China Medical university (07/2023-10/2024)

<br>

**Location: Department of urology, the First Affiliated Hospital of China Medical University**<br>

Role: One of the 5 **initiators** (07/2023)<br>

- In response to the request of the department head, a malignant tumor database for urology was jointly established by **cooperation with four other master's students of the same class** under the guidance of senior doctors (Prof. Mo Zhang and Prof. Jianbin Bi for consultation).<br>

- The database content includes patient IDs, medical history overview, preoperative laboratory tests, radiological manifestations, surgical procedures, pathological results and follow-up section. Created datasheets for data collection and follow-up in software EpiData 3.1.<br>

- The database is divided into 4 major fields: prostate cancer, renal cell carcinoma and urothelial malignant tumor, and follow-up section. Due to the different focuses required, the questions on the datasheet for each field were different.<br>

Role: **Participant** in Data Collection for Prostate Cancer   (08/2023-10/2023）<br>

- Preoperative evaluation and recording of intraoperative and postoperative data, with **20-30 patients** per month.<br>

- Adjustment and redesign of prostate cancer datasheets.<br>

Role: **Leader** of the section: Renal Cell Carcinoma  (11/2023-10/2024)<br>

- Preoperative evaluation and recording of intraoperative and postoperative data, with **15-25 patients** per week.<br>

- ***Delivered the summarized data*** to the leader of the follow-up section for further routine follow-ups.<br>

- ***Provided training*** for junior master's students to join our team. (**2 new members** have joined us)<br>

​       The database we have established is planned for ***long-term operation***, continuously collecting new cases and providing information for clinical treatment of urological malignant tumors, **even after all of us initiators graduate**.<br>

## 3. A Cross-trait Genome-Wide Analysis between lung cancer and a group of diseases (ongoing, secrets until article published)

 **Location: Department of urology, the First Affiliated Hospital of China Medical University**<br>

Role: All the main tasks were completed **on my own**.  I would like to express my gratitude to a friend majored in  bioinformatics who have helped me a lot.<br>

Methods and Software: Bioinformatic analysis (R 4.3.3)<br>

- Based on the summarized  data of large-scale GWAS database, I have explore the shared genetic mechanisms between lung cancer and a certain group of diseases. Potential pleiotropy sites were identified using the PLACO method, and 53 genomic risk SNP sites were identified through annotation using the FUMA tool. (Among them, a total of 46 loci passed the colocalization test). <br>

- Furthermore, 37 pleiotropic genes were identified at the gene level through MAGMA annotation. <br>
- Next, I will compare the data obtained from colocalization analysis with the genetic data of 731 kinds of immune cells in the human body, aiming to reveal the **mediating mechanisms** of various immune cells in the process of  **cancer development**. (Expected to be completed in **January 2025**).<br>

## 4. Follow-up program of patients underwent Robot-assisted Radical Prostatectomy

 **Location: Department of urology, the First Affiliated Hospital of China Medical University**<br>

Role: One of the ***main participants*** in 2022-2023  (07/2022-12/2023)<br>

- Investigated the postoperative recovery status of patients, changes in blood PSA levels, and the presence of recurrence through regular telephone follow-up. (**40-50 patients per year**)<br>

- Submitted the follow-up data to the senior for further analysis<br>
