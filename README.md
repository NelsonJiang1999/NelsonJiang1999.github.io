# Nelsonjiang1999.github.io

My English name Nelson comes from a famous British naval commander in the 18th century. His name is Horatio Nelson (1758-1805). I chose this name not only to express my admiration for his outstanding military achievements, but also to hope that I can remember his courage and unwavering determination in history during difficult times to motivate myself. 

Oh, well... I admit that I am a heavy history enthusiast.
